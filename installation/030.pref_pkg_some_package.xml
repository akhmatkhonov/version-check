<!-- PL/SQL package names (aka rule packages) should start with the component`s package prefix ("pref_" in this example)
     and follow the standard naming convention, i.e "pkg_some_name"
     Packages usually should be created after importing of required objects and rebuilding objrefs
     to ensure package compiles without errors
