<!-- It makes sense to start the installation with trackor types.
     We recommend splitting components into separate files by type and naming them accordingly, ie:
     Menu.xml, Security-Roles.xml, Rules.xml, Imports.xml, etc.
     
     Make sure to add new trackor types to the tree by adjusting the import mode in XML:
     <XITOR_TYPES impMode="IMPORT_RELATIONS">

     Other modes supported for Trackor Types: DONT_ASSIGN_TO_TREE, ASSIGN_TO_ROOT, IMPORT_RELATIONS, IMPORT_RELATIONS_ONLY

     Additionally, import modes are supported for
     - Config Groups(Tabs): DONT_ADD_FIELDS_IF_TAB_NOT_EMPTY, ADD_FIELDS_IF_TAB_NOT_EMPTY, REMOVE_DYN_FIELDS_BEFORE_IMP
     - Fields: THROW_IF_EXIST, SKIP_IF_EXIST, UPDATE_IF_EXIST
     - Menu Applications: UNASSING_ALL_MENU, MERGE_APP_ITEMS
     - Imports: USE_EXIST, THROW_IF_EXIST
     - Reports: USE_EXIST, THROW_IF_EXIST

     Currently, module dependencies are not supported (i.e. one module can't require another one to be installed).
     To archive this capability module developer should provide a list of dependencies in the module`s readme and rely 
     on the existence of certain entities (Trackor Types, Fields, etc).
     Another approach, which works with generic parts of config (for example "Users" Trackor Type), is to include 
     minimally required entities to this module. Make sure, if "Users" Trackor Type already exists, 
     installation of the module will not break it, at maximum, we can add new fields and relations.
