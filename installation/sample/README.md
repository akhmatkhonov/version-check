# Sample Data

The sample data is useful for module overview, testing, development, demo, and other purposes. But usually not needed when the module is installed in the production environment.

The administrator may choose whether he wants to install sample data at the beginning during the installation.

Sample data files should be in "installation/sample" folder in Module repository.

Only CSV files are supported in the "installation/sample" folder at this time.

Sample Data steps are executed at the end of the installation. You also can set order numbers for sample data. 
It is recommended to use order numbers that significantly greater than order numbers of main steps to avoid frequent renaming.
