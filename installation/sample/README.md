# Sample Data

The sample data is useful for module overview, testing, development, demo, and other purposes. However, it is usually not needed when the module is installed in the production environment.

Sample data files should be in "installation/sample" folder in the Module repository.

CSV/MD/XML/SQL files are supported in the "installation/sample" folder.

Sample Data steps are executed at the end of the installation. You also can set order numbers for sample data. 
It is recommended to use order numbers that significantly greater than order numbers of main steps to avoid frequent renaming.
